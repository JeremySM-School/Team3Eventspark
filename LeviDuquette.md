## About Me
I am a senior Computer Science student at UNCG. I work 3rd shift 4 days a week, 10-12 hour shifts. I have a lot of pets, 5 dogs and 3 cats. The cats kept appearing and I have a hard time saying no,,,
I own my home, its a mess but I love it. My dream is to work on software in automotive technology, involving new safety features and interface development/design, along with implementing AI systems. After I work this job for a while, end goal is opening a dog rescue/training/boarding facility, doing that for the most part and just doing small contract jobs on the side for income.

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to be able to get experience that can translate to the workforce and be able to be used for future projects. I hope to learn practical skills in software engineering that can be useful for all parts of future careers.
