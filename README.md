## Description 
> EventSpark is a website that allows the user to be able to easily plan and create group meetings, parties, events and others, the goal is to help people who want to host huge groups of people since creating the event is hard enough, finding the place to have it is something most people struggle with. Customers can use this to create their own events or use one of our presets viewing them from our main page. Hosts can change events, add extra mini events and notify others to join their event if made public. Reviews of these events can also be given from people who attend in order to maintain a fun experience and to spread the fun and knowledge of our hosts to the world.
