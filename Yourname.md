## About Me
I am a gamer who uses his entire life and soul to complete every single game I can on the worst difficulty possible I am probably themost hard headed stubborn fool you will ever meet if you push my buttons.

## My CSC340 Goals
Learn more about git as it is used in a good amount of game projects and mods and I want to know how to use git in order to be able to work with some people in the future on some mods for my favorite games and possibly make games myself.
